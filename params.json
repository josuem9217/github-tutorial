Its very simple and should only take no more than 2 minutes.\r\n* Next you'll want to open up your editor that you're using to write code, for this example we'll use [Cloud9](https://www.c9.io)\r\n* Navidate to settings, assuming you already have an account registered, and look for SSH keys\r\n* Once you it copy the whole key and paste it to your github account in the ssh keys section of settings\r\n* don't forget a tittle\r\n* Now that you have that setup you now have a connection betwwen your C9 account and github.\r\n* Now navigate to your workspace and make sure your in the right directory\r\n* you'll want to be inside \"workspace\" which you can always reach by typing \"cd ..\" into the console.\r\n* Now set up github on your worspace by typing \r\n```\r\nconfig --global user.name \"Your First Name Last Name\"\r\n```\r\nand then\r\n```\r\ngit config --global user.email \"email address\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n####Setting up a Repository is simple\r\n* Firs you open uo github and on the right side there is a create new repository button\r\n* click that and give it a name\r\n* once it has a name and it is created, open it up and click clone\r\n    *but make sure it is on ssh not https\r\n* now type \r\n```\r\ngit clone \"URL\"\r\n```\r\n* and paste the url\r\n* This will now clone the newly created repostory into your worspace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n###Always remember these commands\r\n```\r\ngit status\r\n```\r\n* checks the status of the directory, you shoul do this often to know if you've added any files t the stage or if you've cmmmitted\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit add \"File Name\" or git add . or git add all\r\n```\r\n* yu can use either one to add a file ready to be commited\r\n    * the first one only adds a specific file \r\n    * the second and third one adds all files in that directory\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit commit -m \"message\"\r\n```\r\n* this takes a snapshot of your code but rememeber a short message in the present tense\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit push\r\n```\r\n* this is the final command that you use to push that snapshot back to your github account\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
